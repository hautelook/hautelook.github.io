# Backend and Frontend Roles and Responsibilities

Our teams consist of collections of technologists and product people who collectively create and extend the in-house developed technology platform which best helps HauteLook succeed in its operational and business goals. We create software which allows us to track what items we have for sale, present them to our customers (in both flash sale and persistent formats), execute sales transactions, communicate order information to our warehouse, ship orders from our warehouse to our customers, provide visibility for the business into those things and provide tooling which helps us provide excellent customer service.

We also are responsible for the infrastructure used to bridge between our internal systems and Nordstrom’s and also between ours and the third party solutions we employ.

## Collective Responsibilities

As a department we hold ourselves to the following expectations, regardless of role:

   1. Understand HauteLook’s business model, goals and competitors.
   1. Understand how the work we do advances HauteLook’s business and operational goals.
   1. Be excellent partners with our colleagues in Marketing, Member Care and Production to ensure we give them the best tools and support possible.
   1. Be excellent partners with our Product Managers to design and implement the best possible experiences for our members and internal customers.
   1. Communicate with our non-technologist colleagues in language and concepts comprehensible and relevant to them. Understand their world views and the challenges they face.

## Engineer

The primary job of an engineer at HauteLook is to create quality solutions to business problems, ideally in the most pragmatic way possible. Value [bazaar over cathedral](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Cathedral_and_the_Bazaar). 

An engineer should focus on learning the technology and best practices very well so they are self-sufficient within the team. A good indication of self-sufficiency is how well your Pull Requests are received by your colleagues. Only when an engineer is largely self-sufficient should they start to optimize the speed at which they develop. Speed of development should not compromise the quality of the code.


Some Engineer responsibilities:

   1. Participate as team member in creating user stories.
   1. Participate as team member in estimating the complexity and/or needed development and testing time of user stories.
   1. Design and implement solutions defined by user stories.
   1. Act as a responsible custodian of our software:
      1. Only deliberately introduce technical debt, communicating when this is happening and why.
      1. Adhere to HauteLook-identified best development, testing and documentation practices.
      1. Help to identify and socialize additional best practices and challenge misguided ones (even those currently accepted as best practices).
   1. Share in the ownership of the finished/live product, ensuring it actually accomplishes what it is supposed to do.

Once an engineer has proven to be an effective member of the team, the engineer should start fulfilling one or two responsibilities of a [senior engineer](#senior-engineer).

### QA Engineer

People in QA roles should think critically about what level of testing (e.g. none, manual, automated) makes sense for each change they are working on, in each stage of that change's lifecycle (e.g. design, development, QA, release). The result of testing should be valuable feedback to engineers and product managers concerning the change's likelihood of defectiveness and confidence level of correctness.

Some QA responsibilities:

   * Partner with engineers in designing new functionality, ensuring the proposed design is testable.
   * Partner with engineers in defining test plans around new functionality.
   * Assess the risk of changes in flight in order to inform our decision of if, when and how to deploy them.
   * Write automated testing around new and existing functionality, in order to minimize the rate and risk of regressions. 

### <a name="senior-engineer"></a>Senior Engineer

Senior development and QA engineers are capable of affecting significant positive change within the business and software. A senior engineer is actively involved in the sprint planning and helps create execution plans within the given constraints of the product and technical design. They are comfortable working with product managers and architects to come up with iterative solutions to business problems.

Some Senior Enigneer responsibilities:

   * Create and participate in the RFC process.
   * Suggest better abstractions for the code during the design and review process.
   * Solicit feedback from colleagues.
   * Proactively fix pain points.

## Architect

Architects create the technical design after the Product Managers finish the product design. In doing so, they establish the technical vision for their engineering colleagues so engineers understand what our systems must support in terms functionality, responsiveness and scale. They ensure our infrastructure meets those requirements.

The role is more akin to a shepherd than a dictator. It is critically important that architects have a [strong opinions, weakly held](http://www.saffo.com/02008/07/26/strong-opinions-weakly-held/) mindset.

Some Architect responsibilities:

   * Coordinate the interactions between systems (HauteLook to Hautelook and HauteLook to third party) to ensure that the affordances they offer are correct, performant and easy to use effectively.
   * Help decide what trade-offs are to be made in the design for a given system. They own the responsibility of documenting and communicating these changes to all affected parties.
   * Solicit feedback from engineers on the challenges in implementing the technical design.
   * Create proof of concepts and prototypes to validate architecture and designs.
   * Assist in release planning to minimize the risk and downtime of deployments.

### Enterprise Architect

Identify the changes in our components and the interactions between them necessary to accomplish business initiatives.

Some Principal Architect responsibilities:

   * Ensure that all the architects are creating systems that allow for [semantic interoperability](https://www.wikipedia.com/wiki/Semantic_Interoperability).
   * Have a very clear understanding of how the technology fits within the HauteLook business.

## Engineering Management

The primary responsibility of engineering management roles is to create an environment in which highly motivated, highly capable technologists can thrive.

Some Engineering Management responsibilities:

   * Help technologists understand what the business is trying to do and making our department navigable to the business.
   * Promote a culture of feedback.
   * Set people up for success, by assigning well defined responsibilities, and commensurate decision making authority.
   * Establish a culture which [embraces failure](http://queue.acm.org/detail.cfm?id=2499552).
   * Practice [Fair Process](http://hbr.org/2003/01/fair-process-managing-in-the-knowledge-economy/ar/1).

### Engineering Manager

Engineering Managers manage teams of individual contributors. As the managers working most directly with our technologists, they have the greatest insight into their team members' daily experiences, both good and bad, and are best positioned to provide both help and remediation.

Some Engineering Manager responsibilities:

   * Ensure our development process helps the team execute at a highly productive predictable and sustainable level. Constantly look for ways to improve how we pursue these goals. 
   * Chase down team blockers and remove them, escalating if unable to do so.
   * Communicate with other teams where there are dependencies, and make sure they are able to meet them before making sprint commitments which cannot be met without those dependencies.
   * Identify challenges/opportunities for improvement within the team, give that feedback to those members and management as appropriate.
   * Help the team identify useful metrics to measure themselves by, and help them understand their progress as measured by those metrics. Use those measurements to improve the accuracy of team estimates.
   * Recognition of team and individual achievements, and socialization thereof up and out.
   * Set clear expectations and hold team members accountable. Swiftly address performance concerns.

### Engineering Director

Where Engineering Managers focus on helping teams of individual contributors thrive, Engineering Directors focus on setting their Engineering Managers up for success. They work to empower those managers to do well by their teams, help facilitate communication between teams and between departments.

Engineering Directors are responsible for understanding the technological needs of our department and advocating for their prioritization. They are responsible for identifying the values embodied in our department as currently constructed and ensuring we hire for the values they would have for the department. 

Some Engineering Director responsibilities:

   * Create a clear and meaningful path for career progression.
   * Establish and maintaining clear lines of communication within the team and outside the team.
   * Ensure compensation accurately reflects the work being performed by the individual.
   * Provide mentorship for both team managers and individual contributors
   * Recognition of departmental achievements, and socialization thereof up and out.
   * Remediation of teams which are struggling to perform.
   * The recruiting and retention of team members.
   * Create a technical roadmap that supports the creation of excellent software.
