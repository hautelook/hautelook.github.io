# Platform Engineer

## Responsibilities

We are looking for people who believe SysAdmins and Ops roles are now mostly software positions. This team is responsible for layers 5-7 on the OSI model. There is no racking or wiring as part of this job. You will be creating a platform to run the website and API that makes up our e-commerce business. This platform will be created on servers in our data center and in the cloud.

This job includes tasks like provisioning virtual machines and/or linux containers, writing the core Puppet code that automatically configures each application, making sure that all domain critical components are monitored correctly and orchestrating services to talk to each other. It also includes digging into performance problems and building tools to automate tedious tasks.

We like keeping all this information in Github so Software Engineers are empowered to do things like open up Pull Requests for trivial Puppet changes and write Nagios checks as part of feature development leaving you free to work on challenging problems the majority of the time.

The ideal candidate for this job probably has two shirts with the phrase "Shared Nothing" just in case one gets lost. They realize that DevOps is a culture and not a job description. They also think that dev, QA and staging environments are just as important as production.

   * Build - Create and ship excellent products that help our software get better.
   * Automate – We prefer cattle to pets and think repeatable provision, configuration and monitoring is the best way to document what each server is doing.
   * Measure - We want to answers to questions like “What are our performance bottlenecks at peak traffic?” and “Which API call has the worst 99th percentile response time?” to be as visible and obvious as possible.
   * Share – Participate in a conversational workflow with other Engineers so we all can become better.

## Qualifications

   * Advanced experience with making software run on Linux. Must be very comfortable with the command line and scripting in bash and python.
   * At least 3 years experience working on a website or app with at least 1 million active users. E-commerce experience is a plus.
   * An understanding of the challenges involved in running a large-scale websites and apps.
   * Familiar with configuration management, such as Puppet, Chef or CFEngine.
   * Familiar with monitoring software, such as Nagios, Sensu or CloudWatch.
   * Familiar with cloud computing, specifically AWS and virtualization.
