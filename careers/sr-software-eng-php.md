# Senior Software Engineer (PHP)

## Responsibilities

We are looking for a Senior Software Engineer to write and maintain the core e-commerce services and the RESTful API that powers them. This is a position that requires little html, css and javascript. A lot of your time will be spent working on the core libraries of our company where unit tests can be invaluable. The other part of the job is exposing that functionality via a RESTful API. You must be someone who enjoys working with clients to create APIs that work really well for them.


As a Senior Engineer, you own a wide range of responsibilities including writing and maintaining the APIs and services that power HauteLook.com and NordstromRack.com (and their mobile apps!), writing and maintaining our custom inventory management software and customizing our Solr search engine.

You are a software engineer who is passionate about using code to solve business problems.  When forced to choose between getting it done, and doing it right, you aren't afraid to take the extra time to get it done the right way.  You always include tests in your Pull Requests and often review open Pull Requests because you care about the quality of the codebase. You know your way around the Linux command-line and would rather use existing components than reinvent wheels. You like working with a team and have strong opinions weakly held.

    * Release high quality code as quickly as possible.
    * Work within a multi-disciplinary team employing an Agile approach to development.
    * Create and maintain HauteLook's web services and internal tools.
    * Engineer solutions to E-commerce problems.
    * Mentor other engineers.

## Qualifications

    * At least three years experience developing production quality software.
    * Experience engineering software for a site with many active users. E-commerce experience a plus.
    * Must have experience with PHP. Symfony 2 experience a plus.
    * Must be comfortable writing software against relational databases. MySQL and Doctrine experience a plus.
